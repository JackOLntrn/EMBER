# EMBER
## Overview
The EMBER project makes use of the **MLX90640** thermal camera to detect fires on a pan/tilt motor mechanism. Once a fire is detected, the system points the mechanism at the detected fire and activates a solenoid to spray water from a garden hose at the detected fire. This repository includes all of the relavant files for the project.
