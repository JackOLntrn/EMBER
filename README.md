# EMBER
## Overview
The EMBER project makes use of the a thermal IR camera to detect fires on a pan/tilt motor mechanism. Once a fire is detected, the system points the thermal camera/hose nozzle at the detected fire and activates a solenoid to spray water at the detected fire. The system is supplied with water from a garden hose. This repository includes all of the relavant files for the project.
